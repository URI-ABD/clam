//! A `Spring` is used to preserve the relative distances between two `Mass`es
//! in the original dataset.
//!
//! `Spring`s exert forces on the `Mass`es they are connected to, pulling or
//! pushing them to maintain the relative distances between the `Mass`es when
//! we try to embed them in a lower-dimensional space.
