# CLAM: Clustering, Learning and Approximation with Manifolds

CLAM is a Rust/Python library for learning approximate manifolds from data.
It is designed to be fast, memory-efficient, easy to use, and scalable for big data applications.

CLAM provides utilities for fast search (Cakes) and anomaly detection (Chaoda).

As of writing this document, the project is still in a pre-1.0 state.
This means that the API is not yet stable and breaking changes may occur frequently.
