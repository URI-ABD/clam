//! Distance functions for vectors.
//!
//! # Potentially unexpected behaviors
//! Computing many of these distances with vectors of differing or zero
//! dimensionality may give unexpected results. Specifically, when one vector is
//! shorter than the other, elements in the longer vector past the end of the
//! shorter vector will be ignored.
