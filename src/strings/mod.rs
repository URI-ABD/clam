/// Computes the Levenshtein distance between two strings.
///
/// The Levenshtein distance is defined as the minimum number of edits
/// needed to transform one string into the other, with the allowable
/// edit operations being insertion, deletion, or substitution of a
/// single character. It is named after Vladimir Levenshtein, who
/// considered this distance in 1965.
///
/// We use the Wagner-Fischer algorithm to compute the Levenshtein
/// distance. The Wagner-Fischer algorithm is a dynamic programming
/// algorithm that computes the edit distance between two strings of
/// characters.
///
/// We use penalty values of `1` for all edit operations and we minimize the
/// total penalty for aligning the two strings.
///
/// The input strings are not required to be of the same length.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `a` - The first string.
/// * `b` - The second string.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use distances::strings::levenshtein;
///
/// let a = "NAJIBEATSPEPPERS";
/// let b = "NAJIBPEPPERSEATS";
///
/// let distance: u16 = levenshtein(a, b);
///
/// assert_eq!(distance, 8);
///
/// let a = "TOMEATSWHATFOODEATS";
/// let b = "FOODEATSWHATTOMEATS";
///
/// let distance: u16 = levenshtein(a, b);
